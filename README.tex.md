## Study of second-order phase transitions using the Ising Model

Ising's model is a qualitative model to study second-order phase transitions in ferromagnetic materials. When the temperature  which a ferromagnetic is subjected reaches a certain value, it loses its magnetic properties. This temperature is known as the Curie temperature. At this poing, the second order phase-transitions occurs.

\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}
